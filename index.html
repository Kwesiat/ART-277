<hr>
<p> Dear Mr. Momo,</p><br>
<p>
  Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Starz University's science faculty to study 
as part of your <abbr>PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
<br>
<h2>Starting dates </h2>
<p> We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit 
us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as 
follows:</p><br>
First semester: 9 October2022<br>
Second semester: 15 January 2023<br>
Third semester: 2 May 2023<br>
<p>
  Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
</p>
<p>
  You can find more information about important university dates on our website.
</p>
<h2> Subjects of study </h2>
 <p>At the StarzUniversity, we have a pretty open-minded research facility as long as the subjects 
fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated 
researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas 
you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
<p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>41</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub> )    
Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), 
when the audience size exponentially increases (3×10<sup>3</sup>)
increasing to 3×10<sup>4</sup>
<p> <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</p>
  <p>
  So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd 
expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd 
need to know? Thanks.</p>
<h3>
  Exotic dance moves
</h3>
<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To 
answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

<p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
<p>students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow 
however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really 

A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village <br>
<p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
<p>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s</p> <br>
<p>Arctic robot dance</p>
<p>this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling 
movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on 
would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice 
believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted 
cold.</p>
<p>For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.</p><br>
